# PWA Budget Tracker (Online/Offline Functionality) W.I.P.

The purpose of this assignment to modify an existing Budget Tracker to allow for offline access and functionality.  When the application is used in an offline setting, users are still able to enter expenditures and deposits accordinglyâ€”when reconnected online, the expenses and deposits are added to the tracker.  
To address this issue, a service worker is used to handle the cached data.
